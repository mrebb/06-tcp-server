## Feature Tasks  
For this assignment, you will be building a TCP chatroom. Clients should be able to connect to the chatroom through the use of telnet. Clients should also be able to run special commands to exit the chatroom, list all users, reset their nickname, and send direct messages. You may add as many features to this application as you would like. Do not use any third party libraries and testing is *not* required.

##### Minimum Requirements 
* Create a TCP Server using the NodeJS `net` module
* Create a Client constructor that models an individual connection 
  * Each client instance should contain (at least) `id`, `nickname`, and `socket` properties
* Clients should be able to send messages to all other clients by sending it to the server
* Clients should be able to run special commands by sending messages that start with a command name
  * The client should send `@quit` to disconnect
  * The client should send `@list` to list all connected users
  * The client should send `@nickname <new-name>` to change their nickname
  * The client should send `@dm <to-username> <message>` to send a message directly to another user by their nickname
* Connected clients should be maintained in an in-memory collection (array) called the `clientPool`
  * When a socket emits the `close` event, the socket should be removed from the client pool
  * When a socket emits the `error` event, the error should be logged on the server
  * When a socket emits the `data` event, the data should be logged on the server and the commands below should be implemented

##  Documentation  
Write basic documention for starting your server connection and using the chatroom application.  Be sure to use proper markdown constructs and `highlight blocks of code`.
